# NEUT_validation
Validation for NEUT pion production: just takes output MC ROOT file and plots various distributions. 

Takes input events, classifies them according to signal definitions, and gets various kinematic distributions of interest.

Supports CC0pi, CC1pi0, CC1pi+ signal definitions.

Very hacked for now; should really move to a class system later.
